# GOVUK-Digital-Marketplace-procurement-design-patterns

This is where we're writing about the lessons learned from designing and delivering the procurement that'll create the new 'Digital Outcomes and Specialists' (DOS) framework for the UK public sector.

This is based on a set of procurement and legal design principles that align with the best practice that's being developed by forward-thinking governments around the world.
